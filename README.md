# Psychic-Game

#The Objectives

1. This project is a part of my coursework requirements for the UC Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp. It is a game that generates a random letter that the user has to guess within 10 tries. The wins and losses are are tallied as well as the number of guesses left and the letters guessed. Duplicate guesses are not counted.

1. This was a good challenge working with random math and pushing into arrays. Creating logic to implement the mechanics as well as the rules of the game.





##User Notes

1. This will be deployed and hopefully, it will have some entertainment value. It will be more to highlight what I've learned so far.

1. Please let me know if you have comments on how to make this app better or if you notice some bugs.

1. I would like to learn how to code better and if there's a better way of doing things, please don't hesitate to show me... and kindly explain to me as if I was a 12 year old :)

1. I am not expecting anybody needing help running this eventually but just in case, email monmaramba@yahoo.com.
